# Extension profile: `atlas_calendar`

**What it is.** A world's own calendar: the names a world gives to its time line (months, weeks, eras, leap days). It changes no date. Every date field in OnlyWorlds stays a plain integer in the world's `time_basic_unit`; the calendar only says how to read that integer aloud.

**Key name.** `atlas_calendar`. It keeps its name from before the profile grammar (`x_<profile>_<field>`), because three readers already use it: Atlas, the TypeScript SDK (`CALENDAR_FIELD`) and the Unity SDK.

**On which element.** Any element may carry it; a reader finds calendars by the field being present, never by type or supertype. By convention it sits on a Construct with supertype `calendar`, and that is where Atlas makes one. A world can hold several. Which one a tool speaks is the tool's own choice; Atlas speaks the only one when there is one, and offers a choice when there are more.

**The value.** A JSON object (a reader also accepts the same object as a JSON string; a writer writes the object):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | `1`. Any other value: not a calendar. |
| `grain` | The world's `time_basic_unit` when the calendar was made (`"day"`, `"year"`, ...). One step of the time line. Required: a value without a string `grain` is not a calendar. |
| `step_name` | The culture's word for one step ("Sol"). Optional; defaults to `grain`. |
| `bundles.months` | `names` and `lengths` (same length, each length a whole number of steps from 1). |
| `bundles.year` | `steps`: a year's length, only for a calendar without months. |
| `bundles.week` | `length`, `names`, and `mode`: `free` (default, runs across months, step 0 is `names[0]`) or `nested` (restarts each month). |
| `intercalary` | Days that belong to no month: `name`, `after_month` (0 = before month 1), `every_years` (a leap rule: present in years where the year index divides by it), `in_week` (default true). |
| `eras` | `name`, `abbrev`, `start` (a step), `end`, `restart` (default true: years count from the era), `year_base` (0 or 1, default 1), `direction` (`up`, or `down` for a count toward a pivot, like BC), `closed` (shown for old dates, never offered for new ones). |
| `format`, `format_intercalary` | Templates with `{day} {month} {weekday} {year} {era} {step}` (and `{intercalary}`). Defaults: `{day} {month}, {year} {era}` with months, `{year} {era}` without, `{intercalary}, {year} {era}` for a day outside the months. |

**How a reader turns a date into words.**
1. The date is an integer step. Step 0 opens year 0, and that is fixed: a calendar has no epoch offset. A world that wants day 0 elsewhere stores its dates shifted.
2. Division is Euclidean floor throughout, so negative steps (a backstory) read like positive ones.
3. A year is the months' lengths plus any leap days its year index earns; year index = how many whole years from step 0. The leap rule is a floored modulo, so year 0 is a leap year and negative years follow the same rule.
4. The era is the one whose range holds the step (the latest start wins an overlap; at equal starts an `up` era wins); its year number counts from the year its `start` falls in, from `year_base`.
5. Fill the template. A known token with no value (no week, no era) prints empty and its separator closes up; an unknown token prints as written.

The TypeScript SDK holds this whole as `breakdownStep` and `formatStep` (and `parseDate` back); a reader in another language can port those functions, and the SDK's source is the reference.

**What a reader may ignore.** Unknown keys anywhere in the value. `closed` (it only governs date entry). `grain` in the arithmetic (it does not change how a step is read, but it must be present). `step_name` and the format templates, if the reader prints its own way.

**Not a calendar.** A reader refuses the value, and shows bare numbers, never an error, when:
- `version` is not 1;
- `grain` is not a string;
- the months' `names` and `lengths` are not lists of the same, non-zero length;
- a month length, `bundles.year.steps`, `bundles.week.length` or an `every_years` is not a whole number from 1;
- `bundles.week.names` is not a list;
- `eras` is not a list, or an era lacks a string `name` or a numeric `start`;
- `intercalary` is not a list, or an entry lacks a string `name` or a whole `after_month`.

Every reader refuses the same values, or one tool shows a calendar where another shows numbers.

**What a writer must keep.** Everything it did not change, unknown keys included. A re-key never rewrites the value (it holds no element ids).

Source: the TypeScript SDK's calendar kernel (`@onlyworlds/sdk` 4.40.0: `readCalendarConfig`, `breakdownStep`, `formatStep`), written from Atlas's calendar, which made the field.
